separate the functions into different files; at least:
	a file containing all the heuristics
	a file containing the A* algorithm and helper functions
	a file containing the puzzle generator and UI elements

see if moveUp and returnMoveUp can be combined
	same for the other three

replace all theRoot*theRoot with a second global variable
	also probably rename theRoot to something more descriptive (puzzleWidth? boardSize?)

take the weight = moves out of all the heuristics and put it in the algorithm

make startTime a local variable
	could have solvePuzzle return the solved puzzle instead of exit()ing, and then time that function call

puzzle file without a bad size causes crash

add -p to usage
